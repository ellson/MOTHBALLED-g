- need some obvious output!

- interface cgraph

    container - named-pipe - cgraph-daemon ... result-file-per-container...


- view/query   read annotated output files....

     -- query - maybe without layout

     -- view - probably with layout




- distrubuted edges:

    A:                          B:

    < a ~/B/b >   

                    induces:     
                                < ~/A/a b >

        

            - reconciler
            - view
            - query

        ( anthing acting as ^ )

            < A/a  B/b > 

                - success
                - fail   ....  how is failure dealt with?
                    .. originator retains intent, state: incomplete
                    -- recipient has no state change....

                - partial completion?  (probably should be all or nothing)

            All state must be in enpoint systems.

            After reconciliation, view can be done without rereconcile,
