#1) sameas produces wrong result when "=" matches an ENPOINTSET
#
#e.g.: 
#	<(a b) c>
#	<= d>
#
#produces:
#	
#	a
#	b
#	c
#	<a c>
#	<b c>
#	a
#	d
#	<a d>

#4) quoted string around pattern not getting through
#	"abc"*"xyz"
#
#   patterns not working at all!

#8) some kind of pattern / comment interaction issue causing non-matching act to be repeated
#
#	"ab"*
#	"a"
#produces:
#	"a" "a"
#
#also
#	ab*
#	a
#produces
#	a a

2) nodes introduced with "=" don't require further node induction

3) Some grammar elements are purely for syntax construction and have no representation by themselves:
	OBJECT, LEG, ENDPOINT, .... (particularly elements of lists)
these are consuming elem_t storage, and presumably extra processing.   Can they be eliminated?

5) command line rework ...
	-a [<file>]         ... read archive at init.  <file> defaults to g_archive.tgz
	-A [<file>]         ... write archive on exit.  <file> defaults to g_archive.tgz
	-p [<file>]         ... print main_container on exit.  <file> defaults to "-"  (i.e. stdout)
	-P <name> [<file>]  ... print named container on exit.  <name> can be full name, or namehash
        -i [<file>]         ... print index of hashname to full name. <file> defaults to "-"  (i.e. stdout)
        -d [level]          ... print debugging info to stdout
	-s                  ... print stats to stdout

6) only three characters require BSL escapes ..   BSL in front of any other character should be ignored.

7) quoted strings that don't really need quoting should be emitted unquoted (maybe?)

9) pattern substitution should merge act in output (first subject, merged attributes and container)
