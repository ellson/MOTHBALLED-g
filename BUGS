FIXED 1) sameas produces wrong result when "=" matches an ENPOINTSET

e.g.: 
	<(a b) c>
	<= d>

produces:
	
	a
	b
	c
	<a c>
	<b c>
	a
	d
	<a d>

also, perhaps nodes introduces with "=" don't require further nod induction


2) Some grammar elements are purely for syntax construction and have no representation by themselves:
	OBJECT, LEG, ENDPOINT, .... (particularly elements of lists)
these are consuming elem_t storage, and presumably extra processing.   Can they be eliminated?

3) quoted string around pattern not getting through ..
	"abc"*"xyz"


4) only three characters require BSL escapes ..   BSL in fron of any other character should be ignored.
