#1) sameas produces wrong result when "=" matches an ENPOINTSET
#
#e.g.: 
#	<(a b) c>
#	<= d>
#
#produces:
#	
#	a
#	b
#	c
#	<a c>
#	<b c>
#	a
#	d
#	<a d>

#4) quoted string around pattern not getting through
#	"abc"*"xyz"
#
#   patterns not working at all!

#8) some kind of pattern / comment interaction issue causing non-matching act to be repeated
#
#	"ab"*
#	"a"
#produces:
#	"a" "a"
#
#also
#	ab*
#	a
#produces
#	a a

2) ENHANCEMENT nodes introduced with "=" don't require further node induction

3) ENHANCEMENT Some grammar elements are purely for syntax construction and have no representation by themselves:
	OBJECT, LEG, ENDPOINT, .... (particularly elements of lists)
these are consuming elem_t storage, and presumably extra processing.   Can they be eliminated?

5) ENHANCEMENT command line rework ...
	-a [<file>]         ... read archive at init.  <file> defaults to g_archive.tgz
	-A [<file>]         ... write archive on exit.  <file> defaults to g_archive.tgz
	-p [<file>]         ... print main_container on exit.  <file> defaults to "-"  (i.e. stdout)
	-P <name> [<file>]  ... print named container on exit.  <name> can be full name (i.e. subject), or namehash
        -i [<file>]         ... print index of hashname to full name. <file> defaults to "-"  (i.e. stdout)
        -d [level]          ... print debugging info to stdout
	-s                  ... print stats to stdout

6) ENHANCEMENT only three characters require BSL escapes ..  BSL, DQT and NLL, and only inside DQT strings
BSL in front of any other character in DQT strings should be ignored and elided in output.
BSL outside DQT strings are literal BSLs

7) MINOR quoted strings that don't really need quoting should be emitted unquoted.
Without this canonicalization,  a pattern like a* will fail to match "a"

9) ENHANCEMENT pattern substitution should merge act in output (first subject, merged attributes and container)

10) FIXME processing and storage of pattern contents (can these contain further patterns?)
11) FIXME merging of pattern contents when matching

12) when to introduce and object DB ?


13) the error message for when an input file is not found should be less obscure
    g (master)$ src/g comments.g
Error: fopen fail ACTIVITY
      in "comments.g" line: 1 just before: ""
** partially fixed - could use filename in error message

14) BUG - edge disambiguators not parsed correctly
    $ echo '<a b>`c' | g
    g: sameas.c:68: je_sameas_r: Assertion `subject->type == (char)LISTELEM' failed.
    Aborted (core dumped)
