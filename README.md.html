<p>"g" is a language for describing graphs of nodes and edges.</p>
<p>"g" is a tool for processing "g"</p>
<p>For now, you can think of "g" as a front-end to graphviz tools, 
providing for the descripton and rendering of systems contained in systems,
where each system is described by a graph.</p>
<p>A "first light" example is: <a href="example/abc.txt">link</a>
which is rendered as <a href="example/rendering/top.svg">img</a></p>
<p>I have more work to do before this code is likely to be
of any use to anyone else.</p>
