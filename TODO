1. fix elem leaks 

2. attribute trees,  attribute merging

3. need some kind of print_edge_name
- for compare and for ikea ...
- needs logical space between str elems, and between legs and disambig
-- maybe insert real: < > `

4. breakout PARSE_t from CONTEXT_t

5. common match code for patterns and queries

6. extend match patterns
- currently suffix matching only
- can we find a syntax for REs that fits?
- at least want prefix matching

7. parent{graph patterns stats cron net...}

8. thread and event model
- parser per thread
- inotify input events
- cron-like output events e.g. "cron{^/graph[full=nowtime%3600 diff=nowtime%5]}"
- gdiff - for incremental outputs

9. queries
- return multiple results from applying a match
- edge queries
- meta queries:  ?^g ?^p  ?^s  ?^n    (graph, patterns, stats, net)

10. persistence

11. container updates
- requires:
  1. reading in previous contents
  2. updating,
  3. saving and  computing new content hash
  4. updating content hash in containing object
  5. removing old contents iff no nonger referenced

12. ?? separate threads/processes for layout computation

13. distributed graphs

14. g_pretty with opt for degrees of ecpansion and indentation
