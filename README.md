"g" is a language for describing graphs of nodes and edges.

"g" is a tool for processing "g"

For now, you can think of "g" as a front-end to graphviz tools, 
providing for the descripton and rendering of systems contained in systems,
where each system is described by a graph.

A "first light" example is: [link](first_light.g)
which is rendered as [img](first_light.png)

I have more work to do before this code is likely to be
of any use to anyone else.
