1. Incremental graph creation, modifications throush a stream of "acts"
  - no beginning, no end,  the "graph" is what you see as a result.

2. Edges, Nodes, Clusters, Subgraphs - unified into Objects
  - Any object can have properties
  - Any object can contain graphs (eliminating subgraphs and clusters)

3. Edges can have more than two endpoints,  i.e. netlist support

4. Both nodes and edges can be "multi"

5. MetaObjects with pattern patching for "class" properties

6. '-' is not a special character, so now number strings can be used 
   as simple strings.
